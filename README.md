# liskland
Liskland allows users to add objects to a website using the reference code in a lisk transaction.


Liskland checks the latest x number of transactions from a certain address each 10 seconds. If a transactions has a valid json code in the data field, the script reads the code to retrieve the object and the position. It then places the object on the board and repeats this process.

Build in javascript using lisk elements.
